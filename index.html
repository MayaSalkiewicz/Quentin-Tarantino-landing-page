            <h2>About Quentin Tarantino</h2>
            <p>
              Quentin Tarantino, in full Quentin Jerome Tarantino, (born March
              27, 1963, Knoxville, Tennessee, U.S.), American director and
              screenwriter whose films are noted for their stylized violence,
              razor-sharp dialogue, and fascination with film and pop culture.
              John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction John Travolta
              and Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction Pulp Fiction Pulp Fiction
              Tarantino worked in a video store in California before selling two
              screenplays that became True Romance (1993) and Oliver Stone’s
              Natural Born Killers (1994). In 1992 he made his directing debut
              with Reservoir Dogs, a violent film about a failed jewelry store
              robbery. Two years later he established himself as a leading
              director with Pulp Fiction. The provocative film, which featured
              intersecting crime stories, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film
              festival, and Tarantino later received (with Roger Avary) an
              Academy Award for best original screenplay. For Jackie Brown
              (1997), he adapted an Elmore Leonard novel about a flight
              attendant entangled in criminal activities.
